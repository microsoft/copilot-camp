# Welcome to Copilot Developer Camp!

This repo is for hosting a virtual workshop for developers who want to build agents and connectors for Microsoft 365 Copilot. The content is still in development but our labs are ready for testing; please check it out!

Please visit Copilot Developer Camp at [https://aka.ms/copilotdevcamp](https://aka.ms/copilotdevcamp)

The samples that were hosted here have turned into labs, and the plain samples have moved.
