# Lab MSA - Understanding SharePoint agents

A **SharePoint agent** is the easiest way to create an agent specialized on content stored in SharePoint Online. 
SharePoint agents use the same infrastructure, orchestrator, foundation model, and security controls as Microsoft 365 Copilot, which ensures a consistent and familiar user experience.

The agent provides also custom knowledge and grounding data. The user experience is provided in SharePoint Online, or Microsoft Teams, or Microsoft 365 Copilot.](../../../assets/images/sharepoint-agent.png)

The SharePoint agents can target:

- sites
- libraries
- documents

A SharePoint agent can be used from within the SharePoint Online user experience either in the library where it was created or at site level. A user needs to have *contribute* permissions on the target library to create a SharePoint agent. A site *owner* can promote SharePoint agents at site-level, too.

A SharePoint agent can also be shared in Microsoft Teams to enhance the user experience in chats (one to one or group chats).

Last but not least, a SharePoint agent automatically becomes available in the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat as a custom agent.

If you are assigned with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, or a Copilot Studio capacity, or your organization has the Pay-As-You-Go billing set up, you can use SharePoint agents.
