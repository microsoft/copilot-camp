# Welcome - Make agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot

Welcome to Copilot Developer Camp's Maker Path! In this lab, you will design customised assistants to improve the overall experience of using Microsoft 365 Copilot. The process will begin with the creation of a basic agent using either the Copilot Studio agent builder, or the SharePoint agent capability in SharePoint Online, or Copilot Studio.

In order to better understand the available options and when you should use what, here you can find a helpful table with a brief explanation of each of the options.
