In this path of Extend, you will learn how to use Teams Message Extensions as plugins in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. You will start with a working message extension sample available in the sample[ source code](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-camp/tree/main/src/extend-message-ext/Lab01-Run-NW-Teams/Northwind) and run it as a plugin in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. You will also enhance the code to add some extra features. The source code utilizes the Northwind Database, providing you with the necessary enterprise data to test your plugin like in a real world scenario.
