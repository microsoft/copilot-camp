# Overview of the Declarative Agent with TypeSpec for Microsoft 365 template

With the declarative agent, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot declarative agent can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to Copilot.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts).
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies before working with TypeSpec files.
4. Update the [`main.tsp`](./main.tsp) to configure your agent and its plugins. This is the default entry point for TypeSpec files. 
5. Select `Preview Local in Copilot (Edge)` or `Preview Local in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
6. Select your declarative agent from the `Copilot` app.
7. Ask a question to your declarative agent and it should respond based on the instructions provided.
